# Vellum – Make Markdown files transportable & readable for non MD folks

## Overview

Vellum is a static site generator that transforms Markdown files into self-contained HTML documents. It takes your Markdown content, along with any images or assets, and produces a single HTML file with everything embedded inline. No external dependencies, no CDN links, no separate CSS files.

The generated HTML works completely offline. You can email it, put it on a USB stick, or host it anywhere. Recipients can open it in any browser without needing special software or internet access.

Vellum is designed for people who love writing in Markdown but need to share their work with others who prefer polished, readable documents. Whether you are creating portfolios, documentation, or reports, Vellum handles the conversion while preserving your content structure and styling.
