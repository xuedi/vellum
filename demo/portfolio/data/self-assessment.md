### Self-Assessment Q1 2025

A reflection on my professional growth, strengths, and areas for improvement.

#### Strengths

**Technical Excellence**
I consistently deliver high-quality code with minimal bugs. My understanding of system architecture has grown significantly, allowing me to make better design decisions early in projects.

**Problem Solving**
I enjoy tackling complex problems and breaking them down into manageable pieces. The recent authentication refactor demonstrated my ability to find elegant solutions under tight deadlines.

**Team Collaboration**
I actively participate in code reviews and provide constructive feedback. Team members have mentioned they appreciate my detailed explanations when discussing technical decisions.

#### Areas for Improvement

**Time Estimation**
I tend to underestimate task complexity, especially for unfamiliar domains. I need to add more buffer time and break down tasks more granularly before committing to timelines.

**Documentation**
While my code is well-commented, I sometimes delay writing user-facing documentation. Setting aside dedicated time for docs would improve project handoffs.

**Public Speaking**
I get nervous during large meetings. Practicing presentations beforehand and volunteering for more demo sessions would help build confidence.
