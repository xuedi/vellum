## Manager Feedback

**January 2025 - Quarterly Review**

*Action items:*
- Send weekly status updates to dependent teams
- Schedule monthly sync with Platform team

**February 2025 - 1:1**
> "Good progress on the async refactoring work. I'd like to see you take more ownership of the design phase. Don't wait for direction - propose solutions and bring options to discuss."

- Draft design docs before implementation
- Present trade-offs, not just solutions

## Peer Feedback

**Code Review - Sarah (Senior Engineer)**
> "Your PRs are well-structured and easy to review. The test coverage is thorough. One suggestion: consider adding more context in commit messages about *why* changes were made, not just what changed."

**Project Collaboration - Mike (Product Manager)**
> "Alex is great to work with. Always delivers on time and communicates blockers early. Would love to see more input during planning sessions - your technical perspective is valuable."

**Mentoring - Jamie (Junior Developer)**
> "Alex explained complex concepts in a way I could understand. The pairing sessions on authentication were super helpful. Maybe we could do more scheduled pairing time?"

## Self-Noted Observations

Things I've noticed that I want to improve:

- I sometimes stay quiet in meetings even when I have relevant input
- I could be more assertive about timeline concerns during planning
- Need to celebrate wins more - I tend to move on too quickly
